# Seth Media Addon

This is addon is a simple media repository for sound files that have been generated for my WeakAuras. It is **not** required for my WeakAuras to work.

### Supported WeakAuras:
- [Ageron's Holy Paladin Timers](https://wago.io/uuf_4hK5z) (for WotLK Classic)

### To increase the volume of the sounds:

- Go to `Options` > `System` > `Audio`
- Increase `Master Volume`
- You may decrease the volume of music, sound effects, ambience, and dialog as necessary.
 

### Disabling the sounds:

- Launch WeakAuras (`/wa`)
- Find "Ageron's Holy Paladin Timers" 
- Disable sounds for everything by going to the `Actions` tab and unchecking `Play Sound` under `On Show` and `On Hide`
- Disable the sounds for a specific bundled WA by selecting the child and going to the `Actions` tab and unchecking `Play Sound` in either `On Show` or `On Hide` depending on the child selected.
